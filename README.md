# Football Tactics Test Sim (FTTS)

A 2D football tactics previewer. Pick a **formation**, **fluidity** and **mentality**
for two teams (hotseat), assign each player a **role** and **duty**, and the engine
lays out both sides on a pitch and shows every player's on-pitch responsibility —
computed strictly from a fixed tactics guide (rules 1–7 plus the full
fluidity × mentality × role responsibility tables).

It's a decision aid: test what you have in mind before a real match and see how a
shape and mentality resolve into individual instructions.

## Play

Hosted on GitHub Pages: **https://gorstak-zadar.github.io/FTTS/**

Or open `index.html` locally in any modern browser — no build step, no dependencies.

## How it works

- **Rule 1** — recommended mentality from attacker count (W / AMC / ST).
- **Rule 2** — recommended fluidity from defender count (CB / FB / WB / DM).
- **Rule 3** — what each fluidity level means.
- **Rule 4** — recommended number of support duties per fluidity (lower with 3 CBs).
- **Rule 5** — strong / weak spot (horizontal from fluidity, vertical from mentality).
- **Rule 6** — mentality efficiency across the 90 minutes.
- **Rule 7** — warnings (cards/injuries, decisions, form, weather, home/away).
- **Rule 8** — per-player responsibilities, resolved from the guide's tables.

Team A attacks right, Team B attacks left. Dots show position, role (duty) and the
resolved responsibility.

## Project layout

```
index.html            app shell
css/style.css         theme (matches gorstak.eu)
js/formations.js      formation catalogue (common first, then by defender count)
js/roles.js           positions, valid roles + duties, attacker/defender classification
js/responsibilities.js         resolver + "very fluid" table
js/responsibilities-data2.js   fluid / flexible / structured / highly structured tables
js/engine.js          rules 1–7
js/pitch.js           canvas renderer
js/app.js             UI wiring
test/test.html        in-browser engine self-test
```

## Tests

Open `test/test.html` in a browser to run the engine self-test (rule outputs and a
sampling of responsibility lookups against the guide).
